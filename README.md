# Java Project Template

Clean, reusable starter template for Java projects in IntelliJ.  
Designed for clear object-oriented development with a familiar, organized layout.

This template includes:

- Standard Java `src/` layout  
- Organized package structure (Enums, Interfaces, ObjectClasses, Participants, ExecutableClasses)  
- A starter `Program.java` with a runnable `main` method  
- A `.gitignore` customized for IntelliJ + Java  
- MIT License  
- Simple, readable OOP folder separation  

This structure is inspired by practical patterns used in real projects  
(e.g., card games, simulations, automation frameworks, and service managers).

---

## Running the Program

Open IntelliJ and run:
src/ExecutableClasses/Program.java


It contains a basic `main` method you can replace or rename as your project evolves.

## Using This Template

1. Click **Use this template** at the top of the repository on GitHub.
2. Select **Create a new repository**.
3. Name your project (e.g., `MyProject`, `InventorySystem`, `GameEngine`, etc.).
4. Clone the new repository:
   - **IntelliJ IDEA > Get from VCS > paste your repo URL**
5. IntelliJ will automatically detect:
   - `src/` as the source root  
   - Pre-built package structure  
   - `Program.java` as a valid entry point  

You can begin coding immediately.

## Recommended Usage

Use this template for any new Java project, including:

- School assignments  
- Personal Java practice  
- Automation framework prototypes  
- OOP learning exercises  
- Game engines  
- Utility scripts  
- Technical assessments  

### Why this structure?

It supports clean separation of concerns:

- **Enums** — constants and enumerations  
- **Interfaces** — abstractions for shared behavior  
- **ObjectClasses** — concrete implementations, models, utilities  
- **Participants** — role-based entities (e.g., Player, Dealer)  
- **ExecutableClasses** — classes with `main()` or runnable entry points

## IntelliJ Notes

This template is optimized for IntelliJ IDEA:

- `.idea/` is excluded via `.gitignore`
- `.iml` files are ignored
- `out/` (compiler output) is excluded
- `src/` is automatically recognized as the source root

**Just clone > open > code.**
